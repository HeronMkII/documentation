## Slack

[utatspace.slack.com](utatspace.slack.com)

99% of our communication happens on **Slack**. We recommend downloading the Slack app for your phone + laptop/desktop, and enabling notifications to make sure you can keep up-to-date with all team news. If you are not on the Slack, any current member of the team can add you to it.

### Slack Etiquette
We love Slack because it gives us a informal, quick and easy channel to communicate with everyone on the team! A few guidelines on how to use Slack:
- Join any channel you want! We try to keep all of our technical discussions  on open Slack channels so that any member can join and take a look at what is going on
- If you don't absolutely _have to_ make a private chat/channel, use an open channel! We want to keep communication as open as possible
- We don't judge! It might be intimidating to ask a seemingly simple question on an open channel, but go for it! We encourage it, and someone will be happy to answer
