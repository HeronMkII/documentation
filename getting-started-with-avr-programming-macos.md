# AVR Programming on macOS

The following tutorial will help you get started with AVR programming on macOS. After finishing this tutorial, you'll be ready to compile and upload programs onto AVR microcontrolers.

## Homebrew

To begin, we're going to install Homebrew. Homebrew is a tool that allows you to easily install other programs. It takes care of many details, like updating dependencies and managing versions, so you don't have to.

To install Homebrew, run

 ```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/mas ter/install)"
 ```

This provides a new tool, `brew`. To make sure the installation was successful, run

 ```
 $ brew help
 ```
