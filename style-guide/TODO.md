[**TODO**] These are suggestions, but should be debated with other members.

If statements, while loops, functions, structs, etc. should have the first curly brace on the same line as the declaration, not the following line. There should be a space between the closing parenthesis and the opening curly brace.

```C
// bad
int main(void)
{
    ...
}

//  bad
int main(void){
    ...
}

// good
int main(void) {
    ...
}
```

```C
// bad
if (condition){
    ...
}

// good
if (condition) {
    ...
}
```



Every function should have a high-level description of what it does and whats its parameter and return values are. These should be placed [**TODO before or after?**] the function declaration.
