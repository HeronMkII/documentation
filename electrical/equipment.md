# Equipment

Here is some electrical/hardware equipment you will see and use in the lab (MP 099). We can demonstrate how to use the equipment in-person. These are some of the tools you will use to build, test, and debug circuits.

## Multimeter
Used to measure voltage, current, resistance, and connected points in parts of a circuit.

* **Voltage** - **measured across a component** because voltage is the relative energy between two points
* **Current** - **measured through a wire**; you have to break (disconnect) the circuit at the point you want to measure, then insert the multimeter as a component in series
* **Resistance** - **measured across a component** because resistance is measured between two points
* **Short circuit mode** - used to determine if there is a short circuit **between two points** in the circuit (a direct connection through wires with no components in between)
  * After assembling a circuit, can check that you have made the intended connections
  * Can check that you have not made accidental connections that change your circuit. An unintentional short circuit can change the circuit's behaviour and/or produce a high current that can damage components.

## Oscilloscope
* Used to measure waveforms (signals) over time in a circuit
* This is useful for viewing the raw signal data in a wire, such as a sensorâ€™s output or communication lines

## Function Generator
* Used to generate an AC (alternating current) signal with a specific voltage and waveform

## Power Supply
* Used to generate DC (direct current) power with a specific voltage or current

## Wire Cutters/Wire Strippers
* **Wire cutter** - to cut specific lengths of wire to use on breadboards
* **Wire stripper** - to remove some of the insulation on the end of a wire so it can be connected to a breadboard

## Soldering Iron
* Used to form strong electrical connections between components on PCBs or protoboards
