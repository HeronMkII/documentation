# Binary (0b) and Hexadecimal (0x) Literals

Binary is a base-2 numbering system (digits are either 0 or 1), while hexadecimal is a base-16 numbering system (digits 0-F). Look online for descriptions of how these systems work.

In C, you can express integers using their binary or hexadecimal representations by prefixing them with `0b` or `0x`.

```C
// These represent different numbers
uint8_t binary = 0b01101011;
uint8_t hex = 0xF7;
```
