nsceiver Interface and Debugging
===================================

The current tools we have to communicate with the transcevier, debug it, and safely handle it.

Safety
------

The transcevier is one of the most expensive pieces of equipment we have, and it must be treated with the appropriate care. The biggest risks in handling the transceiver, and mitigation strategies for eachas follows:
* **Electrostatic Discharge**: electrostatic buildup in your body or tools is common, and its sudden discharge (usually referred to as `_ESD_, Electrostatic Discharge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatic_discharge>`_) can negatively affect any electronic component.
      - **Always handle the transceiver on top of ESD-proof mats**. These are the green rubber-ish mats that we have placed on all of our electronics workspaces. The transceiver, once out of its box, should go directly here.
      - **Discharge yourself**: Before handling the transceiver, touch a large, grounded metal surface to discharge any electrostatic buildup on your body
      - **Wear ESD wriststraps**. We should have these in the lab - they prevent electrostatic buildup on your body while you are working
