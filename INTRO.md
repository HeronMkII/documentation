# 1. Introduction

Welcome to the HERON Mk II Gitbook. This is our attempt to create an
ever-growing collection of knowledge, documentation and guides that we have
developed over the past few years while developing software for the various
systems on board our spacecraft.

Eventually, this book will contain most of what you need to know to start
developing code for a _real-time embedded system_. In addition to that, it will
contain all of the guides to get you set up with our _toolchain_ and
_libraries_ you need to properly start developing code for our custom systems.

This repository is primarily managed through
[GitBooks](https://www.gitbook.com/@utat-space-systems), although normal git
functions can be used to apply changes made to articles in the
[Markdown](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/syntax/markdown.html) formatting
language.
