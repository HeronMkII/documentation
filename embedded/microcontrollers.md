# Microcontrollers
A microcontroller is a processing unit, like the brain of a circuit.

## AVR/ATmega32M1
Our subsystem's components will be controlled by the ATmega32M1 microcontroller on the satellite, part of the AVR family of microcontrollers. It is programmed in the C language, and you will need to install the AVR software to compile and upload code to it (which we will help you to get set up).

## Arduino
Arduino is an open-source platform of microcontrollers, which we sometimes use to test components quickly. Since Arduino has more built-in code libraries, it is faster to write and upload code to test individual components than using the AVR microcontroller. Arduino is programmed using a slightly modified version of the C++ language.
