# Software Installation - Windows

Please ask us for help if you encounter any issues. See the "Software Installation" page for descriptions of what these tools do.


## AVR Toolchain

1. Download and install [WinAVR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/files/WinAVR/20100110/). Make sure you get `WinAVR-20100110`. Remember where you installed it - we will call the path `<install>` in this tutorial. By default, it is `C:\WinAVR-20100110`. Leave all of the default installation options (but uncheck "install programmer's notepad").

2. Add `<install>/bin` and `<install>/utils/bin` to your `PATH` variable. Do this from `Control Panel > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment variables`, by choosing to edit the Path variable on the **top** list in the window that pops up. Move `<install>/bin` to the top of the list, and `<install>/utils/bin` to second place.

3. Download [this zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f61X8gvA3odfeqVYECHdmM-gnlFUbaJG/view?usp=sharing). You must be logged in to the Space Systems general member Google account to access it. Unzip this file. Within the extracted folder, take the `WinAVR-20100110` folder and replace the `<install>` folder with it.

Note: You might need 7-Zip or other unzipping software to extract all packages.
