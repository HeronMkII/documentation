# Installing the AVR Toolchain on Windows

The following tutorial will help you get started with AVR programming on  
Windows. After finishing this tutorial, you'll be ready to compile and upload  
programs onto AVR microcontrollers.

## WinAVR

First, download and install WinAVR, version 20100110 through the following  
[link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/files/WinAVR/20100110/). By default, this  
installs WinAVR in `C:\WinAVR-20100110`

If you don't want to install it in this directory just keep a note of where you do install it.  
Leave all of the default installation options \(but probably uncheck _install programmer's notepad\)._

Replace the installation folder with Ali's WinAVR folder \(need link\)
