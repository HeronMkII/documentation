# Introduction

Welcome to the Heron Mk II documentation page! We have created this document
with the following goals in mind:

* To enable new UTAT members to quickly get up to speed and begin contributing
  to the Heron Mk II codebase.

* To document the functionality of the various libraries used to program
  subsystem microcontrollers.

* To act as a comprehensive source of information regarding systems programming
  on the ATMega32m1

We hope this document succeeds in these goals, and we look forward to your
contributions.

To suggest improvements or report bugs, please file a [bug
report](https://github.com/HeronMkII/documentation/issues) on Github.

If you have any additional questions, please contact Siddharth, Ali or Dylan.
