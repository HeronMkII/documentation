# Software Installation - Linux

If you want to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). If you don't know which distro to use, pick Ubuntu.

Follow the installation instructions for macOS to install the same tools, but for command line packages use `sudo apt-get` instead of `brew`. GitHub Desktop is currently not available for Linux.
