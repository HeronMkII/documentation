# Reading Datasheets

A datasheet is a technical document that provides detailed information about the operation of a component, written by the company that designed it.

Datasheets are generally very dense and technical, so they are often confusing and difficult to read. This is an important skill and resource, so the key is learning how to find the information you want for a particular purpose.

For your subsystem, the datasheets you work with will usually be located in a Literature folder within your subsystem folder on the Google Drive. You can also search for datasheets on the Google Drive or using a general Google search.

Here is some of the most commonly used information in datasheets for different purposes.

## Electrical (prototyping or PCB design)

- pin configurations and descriptions
- package/footprint/dimensions
- power supply voltage or other voltage reference
- grounding and layout

## Software

- pin configurations and descriptions
- register descriptions and bit allocation
- digital interface
- timing diagrams (usually SPI)
- operational modes
